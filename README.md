# RR1_16S_data
This repository includes files and code related to data from Romaine Rally I samples. These samples were part of a pilot study comparing aggregative swabs of romaine lettuce to romaine lettuce tissue samples from a field in Salinas, CA. The study used romaine lettuce from a local grocery store as an outgroup. The sequencing was done using full length 16S rRNA sequencing on a PacBio instrument.
